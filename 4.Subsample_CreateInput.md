SUBSAMPLING AND CREATING AN INPUT FOR `PHRAPL`
=======

Multiple samples improve the accuracy of the results. However, the computational time required may be large. It has been shown that the same models are obtained using a subsampling strategy or a full data set strategy. `PHRAPL` implements a subsampling strategy.

Fig. Subsampling. A representation of subsampling when there are two loci and four populations with different sample sizes: A= 16, B=13, C=8 and D=3. In this example 3 individuals per population were sampled, no replicates are shown.

__Follow the next steps to subsample your data and create an input file for `PHRAPL`__

## Load input files

```r
setwd("/your_working_directory/")
library(phrapl)

#############################
#####   Load input files  ###

# Assignement file
currentAssign<-read.table(your_working_directory/CladeAssignments.txt)

# Trees file
currentTrees<-read.tree(your_working_directory/trees.tre)
```

## Define arguments

```r
#############################
#####   Define arguments  ###

# Number of population and individuals per population that will be subsampled
### Simulations showed that 2 or 3 individuals per population are enough.
popAssignments<-list(c(2,2,2))    # 3 populations and 2 individuals per population

subsamplesPerGene<-200       #100 might be enough.
```
 
## Do subsampling
Read more about how to subsample trees in the [`PHRAPL` vignette](https://github.com/bomeara/phrapl/blob/master/doc/phrapl_vignette.Rmd), section III.

```r
#############################
####  Do subsampling  #######

observedTrees<-PrepSubsampling(
assignmentsGlobal=currentAssign,      # the population assignments table
observedTrees=currentTrees,           # the original trees
popAssignments=popAssignments,        # the number of tips subsampled per population
subsamplesPerGene=subsamplesPerGene,  # the number of replicate subsamples to take per locus
outgroup=FALSE,                       # whether an outgroup is present in the dataset (TRUE or FALSE)
outgroupPrune=FALSE)                  # whether an outgroup, if present, should be excluded from the subsampled trees
```

## Get subsample weights
Read more about how to calcule degeneracy weights for subsampled trees in the [`PHRAPL` vignette](https://github.com/bomeara/phrapl/blob/master/doc/phrapl_vignette.Rmd), section IV.

```r
#############################
### Get subsample weights ###
subsampleWeights.df<-GetPermutationWeightsAcrossSubsamples(popAssignments=popAssignments,
observedTrees=observedTrees)
```

## Save `PHRAPL` input

You only need to subsample and calculate subsample weights __one time__, even if you are running different sets of models (`migrationArray`)
```r
save(list=c("observedTrees","subsampleWeights.df"),file=phraplInput.rda)
```

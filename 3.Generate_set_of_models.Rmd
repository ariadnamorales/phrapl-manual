GENERATING A SET OF MODELS
=======

The first thing you will need is a set of models. `PHRAPL` can generate and explore all possible demographiic scenarios, but you need to be sure you know what models will be explored. __Please take some time to read and understand the free parameters section.__

## Free parameters

`PHRAPL` will assign a certain number of free parameters (specified by the user or automatically) to __coalescent events, population sizes, and migration rates.__ The number of free parameters will constrain the possible number of histories (model space search). For _n_ sampled populations, the number of possible models will increase factorially.

Fig. Number of free parameters and the number of possible models.


### Population sizes
__For the moment__, the free parameters will only be assigned to migration rates and coalescent events. `PHRAPL` will always assign one parameter to population size, otherwise the populations do not exist. This parameters for the moment is not "free", and should not be counted to generate a 'migrationArray' object.


### Collapse (or coalescent) event 
There are $[(2n)-1]$ possible events of populations merging (coalescent events). Each coalescent event will require one parameter. If this value is 0, your system represents an island population model.


Fig. Example of free parameter assignments to coalescent events when K=1, K=2 and K=3. There are not migration events.

### Migration
There are $(N^2 - N)$ possible migration rates between populations.

## What is a `migrationArray` object?

A `migrationArray` object will list the models that will be explored by `PHRAPL`. Depending on your question, you only need to generate a `migrationArray` object once for a specific number of poulations, migration rates, collapse events, and/or population sizes.

We recommend to generate a `migrationArray` object with a full set of models (i.e. isolation-only, migration-only and, isolation-with-migration) forcing symmetric migration. Then fix one or a few topologies and allow assymetric migration.

## Generating a `migrationArray` object
This example generates a set of models for 3 population, where symmetric migration is forced and all possible topologies will be included.

migrationArray<-GenerateMigrationIndividuals(
popVector=c(2,2,2),               # how many population/species/groups do you have? If you have 2, then type c(2,2) or c(3,3) [the number of individuals doesn't matter here]. In this example there are 3 populations.
maxK=3,                           # maximum number of parameters in total (considering migration rates and coalescent events)
maxMigrationK=1,                  # maximum number of parameters that will be assigned to migration rates
maxN0K=1,                         # maximum number of parameters that will be assigned to population sizes
forceSymmetricalMigration=TRUE,   # Do you want to generate a set of model with symmetric migration among all populations? (TRUE/FALSE)
forceTree=FALSE)                  # Do you want to force all population to collapse? (if TRUE only fully-resolved trees will be included in the set of models)
 
migrationArrayMap<-GenerateMigrationArrayMap(migrationArray) 
save(migrationArray,migrationArrayMap, file="MigrationArray_3Pop_4K.rda")
```


This example generates a set of models for 3 population, where asymmetric migration is allowed and two topologies are fixed.

parallelRep=c(2,4))               # You can choose what topologies are included in the set of models. For example, for tree populations there are 8 possible topologies. In this example we are only interested in topologies 2 and 4. 

migrationArrayMap<-GenerateMigrationArrayMap(migrationArray) 
save(migrationArray,migrationArrayMap, file="MigrationArray_3Pop_4K_AssymMig_forcedTree_2and4.rda")

HOW MODELS ARE BUILT IN `PHRAPL`?
=======

__As you will notice, the models can be as complicated as you want. But adding parameters to the models will significantly increase computational time.__

First, you need to understand how the models are built in `PHRAPL`. Load a migrationArray object and pick a model

```r

setwd("/your_working_directory/")
library(phrapl)
###

#load a migrationArray object
load("MigrationArray_3Pop_3K.rda")

# Here we are interested in model 22
migrationArray[[22]]
```

You will see something like this
```r
> migrationArray[[22]]
$collapseMatrix
     [,1]
[1,]    1
[2,]    1
[3,]    1

$complete
[1] TRUE

$n0multiplierMap
     [,1]
[1,]    1
[2,]    1
[3,]    1

$growthMap
     [,1]
[1,]    0
[2,]    0
[3,]    0

$migrationArray
, , 1

     [,1] [,2] [,3]
[1,]   NA    1    1
[2,]    1   NA    1
[3,]    1    1   NA

```


# `$collapseMatrix`
`$collapseMatrix` represents coalescent (or collapse) events between populations. In the previous example (for model 22), all three populations collapse at time one [,1]. 

In an example for 3 populations where pop2 and pop3 collapse at time 1, but pop1 does not collapse with the ancestral population of pop2 and pop3, you would see something like this:

```r
$collapseMatrix
     [,1] [,2]
[1,]    0    0
[2,]    1    0
[3,]    1   NA
```


In an example for 3 populations where pop2 and pop3 collapse at time 1, and pop1 collapse with the ancestral population of pop2 and pop3 at time 2, you would see something like this:

```r
$collapseMatrix
     [,1] [,2]
[1,]    0    1
[2,]    1    1
[3,]    1   NA
```


# `$n0multiplierMap`
`$n0multiplierMap` represents population sizes. In the previous example (for model 22), all three populations have the same population size. 

In an example for 3 populations without collapse events where pop2 and pop3 have the same population size, and pop1 has a different population size at time 1, you would see something like this:

```r
$n0multiplierMap
     [,1]
[1,]    1
[2,]    2
[3,]    2
```
__These values do not indicate that one population is smaller or bigger than other(s), just that they are different.__

In an example for 3 populations where pop2 and pop3 collapse at time 1 and pop1 collapses at time 2, and pop2 and pop3 have the same population size, but pop1 has a different population size at time 1, and their ancestral populations have the same population size at time 2, you would see something like this:

```r
$`n0multiplierMap`
     [,1] [,2]
[1,]    1    3
[2,]    2    3
[3,]    2   NA
```


# `$growthMap`
`$growthMap` represents whether population sizes have changed (1=yes, 0=no). In the previous example (for model 22), the population size of the three populations remained constant. 

In an example for 3 populations where pop2 and pop3 collapse at time 1 and pop1 collapses at time 2. Pop2 and pop3 did not grow, but pop1 grew at time 1. Ancestral populations have the same population size at time 2, you would see something like this:

```r
$growthMap
     [,1] [,2]
[1,]    1    0
[2,]    0   NA
[3,]    0    0
```


# `$migrationArray`
`$migrationArray` represent migration events between populations. In the previous example (for model 22), symmetric migration occurs among all populations at time one (,,,1).

In an example for 3 populations where there is symmetric migration between pop2 and pop3 at time 1, and there symmetric ancestral migration you would see something like this:

```r
$migrationArray
, , 1

     [,1] [,2] [,3]
[1,]   NA    0    0
[2,]    0   NA    1
[3,]    0    1   NA

, , 2

     [,1] [,2] [,3]
[1,]   NA    1   NA
[2,]    1   NA   NA
[3,]   NA   NA   NA
```
